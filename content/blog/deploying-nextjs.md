Next.js is a powerful framework for building modern web applications. One of its standout features is how seamlessly it integrates with Vercel, the platform created by the same team.

## Why Vercel?

Vercel provides a zero-configuration deployment experience for Next.js. You get:

- **Global Edge Network**: Your app is served from locations closest to your users.
- **Automatic SSL**: HTTPS is handled for you out of the box.
- **Preview Deployments**: Every pull request gets a unique URL to test changes.

## Steps to Deploy

1. Push your code to a Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
2. Import your repository into Vercel.
3. Configure your build settings (usually defaults work perfectly).
4. Hit "Deploy"!

Stay tuned for more tips on optimizing your Next.js builds!
